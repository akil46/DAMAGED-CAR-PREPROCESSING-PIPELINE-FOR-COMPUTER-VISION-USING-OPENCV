# DAMAGED-CAR-PREPROCESSING-PIPELINE-FOR-COMPUTER-VISION-USING-OPENCV
1. Purpose:The main goal of a damaged car preprocessing pipeline is to *prepare vehicle images for accurate damage detection and analysis* using computer vision models. Preprocessing improves image quality, removes noise, and highlights regions of interest (like scratches, dents, broken parts), enabling better performance for detection or classification algorithms.
* *Computer Vision*: For image analysis and feature extraction.
* *Machine Learning / Deep Learning* (optional next step): For damage detection or classification after preprocessing.
* *OpenCV*: Core library for image processing operations.
* *Python*: Programming language for implementation and scripting.
*OpenCV (cv2): Image reading, resizing, filtering, edge detection, contouring.
* *NumPy*: Array manipulation and matrix operations.
* *Matplotlib/Seaborn* (optional): For visualizing processed results.
* *scikit-image / PIL* (optional): Alternative or complementary image processing.

This preprocessing pipeline is used to:

* Normalize image data (resize, scale pixel values).
* Remove noise and enhance features using filters (Gaussian blur, sharpening).
* Convert color spaces (e.g., BGR to grayscale or HSV).
* Detect edges and contours to isolate damaged regions.
* Generate clean, standardized input for ML models in insurance, repair estimation, or automated damage report system.
